restful_book_app
================

An example RESTful application from Addy Osmani's book "Developing Backbone.js Applications" (http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/#exercise-2-book-library---your-first-restful-backbone.js-app)

This app is set up with the Yeoman Backbone generator and uses RequireJS for Asynchronous Module Definition. Other than that I'm walking through the tutorial in the book and saving to github as I go.
